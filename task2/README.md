# Animal Detection Pipeline

This project implements a pipeline for animal detection using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for text and an image classification model. The pipeline takes text and an image as input and determines whether the animal mentioned in the text is present in the image.


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tatarenstas/Winstars-AI-test.git
    cd Winstars-AI-test/task2
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Python script `pipeline.py` to execute the animal detection pipeline using your text and images.

### Update
The ner_model.pth file is too large for GitHub (410 MB) and cannot be uploaded to the repository. However, you can download the model from the following link:
