# Winstars AI Test Project

This repository contains the solutions for the Winstars AI tasks

## Folder Descriptions

- **Task 1**: Contains the implementation for image classification using the MNIST dataset. It includes the Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network models, along with their respective training scripts and interfaces.

- **Task 2**: This folder includes the project for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) and image classification pipeline. It consists of the NER model for extracting animal names from text, an image classification model for identifying animals in images, and a pipeline that combines both models to determine if the text description matches the animal in the provided image.

For detailed descriptions and implementation notes, please refer to the README files located within each task folder.
