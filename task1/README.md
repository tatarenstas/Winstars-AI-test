# MNIST Image Classification with Multiple Models

This project contains an implementation of three different machine learning models for classifying MNIST images:
1. Random Forest (RF)
2. Neural Network (NN)
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tatarenstas/Winstars-AI-test.git
    cd Winstars-AI-test/task1
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook `mnist_classifier_demo.ipynb` for a demo of how to train and evaluate the models on the MNIST dataset.
